## Decision

### What We Decided

Clearly state the decision made:

> **We will [action/choice] using [approach/technology]**

Example:

> **We will standardize on Pydantic v2 for all data validation**, using discriminated unions for polymorphic type handling.

### Why This Decision

Explain the key reasons for this choice:

1. **Reason 1**: How it solves the main problem
2. **Reason 2**: Additional benefits
3. **Reason 3**: How it meets requirements

### How It Works

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class User(BaseModel):
    """User model with validation."""
    name: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    email: str = Field(..., regex=r'^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$')
    age: int = Field(..., ge=0, le=150)

# Usage
user = User(name="John", email="john@example.com", age=30)
```

# Concrete example of the implementation
class YourComponent:
    """Component implementing the ADR decision."""

    def __init__(self, config: YourConfig):
        """Initialize with configuration."""
        self.config = config

    def process(self, data: InputData) -> OutputData:
        """Process data using the decided approach."""
        validated = self.validate(data)
        result = self.transform(validated)
        return result
```

### Configuration

Document any configuration options:
