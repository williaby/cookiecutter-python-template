# OSV-Scanner Vulnerability Exceptions
# OpenSSF Scorecard uses OSV-Scanner to detect vulnerabilities
# This file documents false positives and vulnerabilities that don't affect this project
#
# Reference: https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/configuration/
# Format: [[IgnoredVulns]] with id and reason fields
#
# When to add exceptions:
# 1. Withdrawn vulnerabilities that are no longer valid
# 2. Vulnerabilities in old versions (current version is much newer and fixed)
# 3. Vulnerabilities that don't affect this project's codebase
# 4. False positives from vulnerability scanning tools
#
# IMPORTANT: Only add exceptions after careful analysis. Never ignore real vulnerabilities.
# Each exception MUST include:
# - id: CVE or advisory ID
# - reason: Detailed explanation of why this is safe to ignore

# ============================================================================
# Example: Withdrawn Vulnerability
# ============================================================================
# Uncomment and customize for your project:
#
# [[IgnoredVulns]]
# id = "CVE-XXXX-XXXXX"
# reason = "This CVE was withdrawn on YYYY-MM-DD due to [reason]. Not applicable to this project."

# ============================================================================
# Example: Fixed in Current Version
# ============================================================================
# Uncomment and customize for your project:
#
# [[IgnoredVulns]]
# id = "PYSEC-YYYY-NNN"
# reason = "Fixed in package-name >= X.Y.Z (released YYYY-MM-DD). Current version: X.Y.Z. Vulnerability does not apply."

# ============================================================================
# Example: Not Used in Project
# ============================================================================
# Uncomment and customize for your project:
#
# [[IgnoredVulns]]
# id = "GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
# reason = "Vulnerability affects [specific feature] which is not used in this project. Safe to ignore."
