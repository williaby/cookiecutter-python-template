# 3. Get approval from security team member
# 4. Reference the exception ID in your code comments if needed
# 5. Exceptions are automatically reviewed quarterly

# Expired exceptions:
# Exceptions past their expiry date will trigger warnings
# Either extend the expiry with justification or fix the underlying issue

# Move expired or resolved exceptions here for historical record
# This helps track patterns and prevent regression
